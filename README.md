# Final-Project

**Instructions:** For the final project you will be working without a partner. You are welcome to discuss ideas with other classmates, tutors, instructors or myself but all work must be your own. 

Think of this project as a way to show of somethings you learned in Intro to Data Science.

**There are five parts to this project:**

1.  A question posed about one of the data sets on the server at Smith

2.  At least a 5 line query written in SQL.

3.  Some use of R beyond ggplot and basic wrangling

    i.  Think of the joins, pivots, map(), function creation, read_csv(), an api, etc.

4.  A quality graph that tells a story to answer your question

    i.  Include: Title, axes labels, caption, source[^readme-1], etc.

    ii. Consider the visual hierarchy.

    iii. A purposeful color choice, do not use default colors.

    iv. A thoughtful theme, do not use the default.

5.  A short write up on your findings, the graphing choices you made, and/or ethics involved in your data. (200-300 words).

[^readme-1]: Data from the server can use the web address of the server and date of acquisition as the source. Data from other places should be cited appropriately.
Note: You are welcome to use another dataset that is not on the server if you would like. You can also do additional data wrangling of data on the server in R with dbplyr().

This will be slightly more difficult than a lab because you are given less guidance. But it should not feel much longer.

You'll have two class days to work on this. It is due by December 14 at midnight. Submit your rendered file to github.
